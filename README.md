Inventory system for controlled substances for a veterinary hospital

Prior to creating this application, my veterinary hospital did not have a true inventory system for controlled substances. The only way that controlled substances were
tracked was by writing down the medication in an old notebook. I created this application in order to better track the inventory for these medications. Medications can be either 
oral or injectable. Each one contains different attributes. Each employee is given a username and password. There can be two types of users which are administrators and 
general users. Only administrators have access to the user features which include adding or editing a user. Regular users only have access to adding, updating, or deleting
a medication. Relevant information about each medication is included such as the name, concentration, quantity in stock, and the size of the vial.
